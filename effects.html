        <h3>Rising Sea levels</h3>
        <hr id="line">
        <h4>Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another 1 to 8 feet by 2100. This is the result of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.</h4>

        <h3>Heavy Precipitation </h3>
        <hr id="line">
        <h4>Extreme rain events have devastated communities around the nation â€” and the frequency and severity of such events are expected to worsen in a warming world. ... So when weather patterns lead to heavy rain, there is even more moisture available for stronger downpours, increasing the risk and severity of flooding</h4>

        <hr id="line">
        <h4>More frequent and intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans can directly harm animals, destroy the places they live, and wreak havoc on people's livelihoods and communities. As climate change worsens, dangerous weather events are becoming more frequent or severe.</h4>

        <hr id="line">
        <h4>Melting glaciers add to rising sea levels, which in turn increases coastal erosion and elevates storm surge as warming air and ocean temperatures create more frequent and intense coastal storms like hurricanes.</h4>
