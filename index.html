        <h2 class="white">What is Climate Change?</h3>
        <h3 class="white">Climate is the average weather condition in a particular area over a long time period. Climate does not only include temperature but also includes, precipitation (snow and rain), Humidity, wind and even seasons (winter, summer etc.)</h3>
   <h2 class="white">What are the causes of Climate Change?</h2>
   <h3 class="white">Over the past century, human activities have been warming the climate. Here are few activities which affect our cimate the most- </h3>

    <h3>Burning of Fossil Fuels</h3>
    <hr id="line">
    <h4>When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming. Already the average global temperature has increased by 1C.</h4>

    <h3>Deforestation</h3>
    <hr id="line">
    <h4>Tropical forest trees, like all green plants, take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen during photosynthesis. ... When trees are cut down and burned or allowed to rot, their stored carbon is released into the air as carbon dioxide. And this is how deforestation and forest degradation contribute to global warming.</h4>

    <h3>Permafrost</h3>
    <hr id="line">
    <h4>
        Permafrost thaw contributes to a positive feedback loop that further accelerates the warming of Earth, releasing methane, which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon, directly into the atmosphere, and contributing to the spread of devastating Arctic wildfires</h4>

    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <hr id="line">
    <h4>The environmental effects of transport is significant because transport is a major user of energy, and burns most of the world's petroleum. This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide.</h4>
